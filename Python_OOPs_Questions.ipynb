        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* An oject is a real thing creating using class. An object is an instance of cladd. its a collection of attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features or functionalities of an object or system.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Encapsulation, on the other hand, focuses on bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class, and restricting direct access to the internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dunder method is also known as special method. Dunder method start from double underscores so dunder method in python that starts and end with double underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept that enables a new class, known as the derived class (or subclass/child class), to acquire the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an existing class, known as the base class (or superclass/parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* It allows you to use same methods or operation on different types of object and  behaves differently depending on objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Encapsulation binding that attributes and methods that operate onthe data into a single unit.\n",
        "* It also helps in restricting direct access to some components of an object - this is called data hiding.\n",
        "* Means hiring the internal details of an object and only allows access it through public methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* A class method is defined using the @classmethod decorator above the method definition.\n",
        "* A static method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator above the method definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Method overloading, in the context of object-oriented programming, refers to the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but have different parameters (either in number or type). This allows a single method name to perform different actions based on the arguments it receives.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Method overrididng is when a subclass(class) defines a methods with same name as method in its parent to change or extent its behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The @property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows methods within a class to be accessed like attributes. It provides a \"Pythonic\" way to manage access to class attributes by defining getter, setter, and deleter methods, while maintaining a clean and intuitive attribute-like access syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* It allows you to use same methods or operations on different types of objects and behaves differently depending on objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to serve as a blueprint or template for other classes. It defines a common interface that subclasses must adhere to by including one or more abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages, including improved code organization, reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. These benefits stem from key OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class Method : i. Class methods are used when you want to work with the class itself (not specific object).\n",
        "* ii. You use @classmethod and cls instead of self.\n",
        "* iii. It can access class variables, not object specififc data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Instance method : i. It is used when you want to work with object data.\n",
        "* ii. Here you need self in this method.\n",
        "* iii. It can access both instance variable and class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent (or base) class. This means a single child class can combine the functionalities and characteristics of several distinct parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (also known as \"dunder methods\") used to define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different purposes and are intended for different audiences.\n",
        "* __str__ is meant to provide a user-friendly, readable representation of an object. __repr__ is intended for developers and should return an unambiguous representation of the object's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The super function in python is used to call methods from parent class inside a child class.\n",
        "* It is especially useful in inheritance when you want to access parent class method.\n",
        "* Avoid code repeating.\n",
        "* Support method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The __del__ method in Python serves as a destructor. Its significance lies in providing a mechanism to define cleanup actions that should be performed when an object is about to be destroyed, typically during garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Python, both class methods and static methods are defined within a class but differ in their access to class and instance data and their primary use cases.\n",
        "* i. Class method Definition:\n",
        "Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "* i. Static method Definition: Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "* ii. Class Methods: First Argument: Automatically receive the class itself as their first argument, conventionally named cls..\n",
        "* ii. Static Methods: First Argument: Do not receive any special first argument (neither self nor cls).\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Polymorphism in Python, particularly in conjunction with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This is achieved primarily through method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Method chaining is a powerful technique in Python programming that allows us to call multiple methods on an object in a single, continuous line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The __call__ method in Python serves the purpose of making instances of a class callable, meaning they can be invoked as if they were functions. When an object with a defined __call__ method is called using parentheses (e.g., obj(), obj(arg1, arg2)), the __call__ method of that object is automatically executed."
